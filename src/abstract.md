<!-- why we need to design a multi-source ALTO server [[[-->

The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol enables the
distributing of network information to applications.  [](#RFC7285) introduces
four specific ALTO information services mainly focused on the "cost" between
endpoints.  In this document, the problem of collecting general network
information, especially the case of collecting from multiple different sources,
is raised from the ALTO server implementation perspective.  A preliminary
solution is then provided, which extends the ALTO protocol with some new
information services.
