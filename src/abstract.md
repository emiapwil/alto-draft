<!-- why we need to design a multi-source ALTO server [[[-->

The Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) protocol enables the
distribution of certain network information to applications.  Hence, a
fundamental functionality of an ALTO server is to collect general network
information, especially from multiple "information sources".  In this document,
we propose a preliminary solution to standardize the process of information
collection for ALTO servers by extending the ALTO protocol with some new
services, which can also serve as a unified approach of network information
distribution.
