<!-- why we need to design a multi-source ALTO server [[[-->

This document discusses several issues regarding the implementation of the
Application-Layer Traffic Optimization (ALTO) services, which is described in
[](#RFC7285).  The topics include the communication protocols between an ALTO
server and the information sources, extensions to the Information Resource
Directory (IRD) service and some approaches that can be taken on the development
and deployment of ALTO.
