# IRD Extensions
<!-- [[[ -->

Unlike other ALTO services defined in [](#RFC7285), whose communications with
information sources can vary, the Information Resource Directory (IRD) service
is relatively simple and well-defined.  In this section we introduce several
extensions on this particular ALTO service, including:

- Management;
- Filtering on IRD entries;
- New specifications of capabilities that are useful in real-world deployment.
